# CWE Automator
A machine learning approach to automatically assign [Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers](https://cwe.mitre.org/) to vulnerabilities disclosed in the industry. This effort is based on a project by students of the [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/) and a collaboration with [Cisco Systems](https://cisco.com).
